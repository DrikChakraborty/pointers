 What is a Pointer in C?
A pointer is a derived data type in C that can store the address of other variables or a memory. We can access and manipulate the data stored in that memory location using pointers.
Pointers in C are used to store the address of variables or a memory location. This variable can be of any data type i.e, int, char, function, array, or any other pointer. Pointers are one of the core concepts of C programming language that provides low-level memory access and facilitates dynamic memory allocation.
